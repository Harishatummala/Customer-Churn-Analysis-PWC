Customer Analysis:

•	Total subscribed customers: 7,043.

•	Gender distribution: 3,555 males and 3,488 females.

•	Total revenue earned: $16.1M.

•	Majority of customers (84%) are young (5,901).

•	About 31% of customers have a tenure of fewer than 12 months, mostly on month-to-month contracts.

•	Fiber optic internet is popular, but it comes with high charges.

•	73.5% of customers have been retained (5,174).



Customer Churn analysis:

•	Churned customers: 1,869 (26.5%).

• Gender doesn't significantly impact churn.

•	1,037 customers with less than 12 months tenure churned, while only 93 with 61-72 months tenure.

•	89% of churned customers were on month-to-month contracts.

•	High charges and fiber optic internet users had the highest churn rate (1,274).



Churning Factors:

•	Young customers are more likely to churn.

•	Customers with less than 12 months tenure are prone to churn.

•	Month-to-month contracts increase churn risk.

•	Subscribing to fiber optic internet and high charges are key factors contributing to churn.


       
Suggestions made:

•	 Increasing the basic contract plan from 1 month to 3 months or 6 months can be a good starting point. This will help customers to be with us for a longer tenure.

•	 Starting special offers or schemes for customers who are single and have no family responsibility. They can become a permanent customer of the company. 'Catch them Young' is key to success here.

•	 provide some offers to the senior citizens as they are stable customers like overall offer some discounts on long tenure plans.

•	 Offering basic services like device protection, tech support, and online security should be the primary goal. This will help the customer stay longer with the brand.
